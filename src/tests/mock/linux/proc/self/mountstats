@SuperQ It's trading hassle for granularity. /proc/net/rpc/nfs reports global stats for the entire NFS client while /proc/self/mountstats includes more details and breaks it down for each mount but the format wasn't designed to be easily parsed. I work in an environment with a bunch of different NFS servers and mounts so the ability to break the metrics down by mount would be really useful but I recognize that it's a lot more work.

Here's an example with a 4.6-series kernel:

/proc/net/rpc/nfs:

net 0 0 0 0
rpc 105 0 105
proc3 22 0 6 0 86 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 1 0
proc4 59 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
/proc/self/mountstats:

device sysfs mounted on /sys with fstype sysfs
device proc mounted on /proc with fstype proc

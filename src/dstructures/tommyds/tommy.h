/** \mainpage
 * \section Introduction
 * Tommy is a C library of array, hashtables and tries data structures,
 * designed for high performance and providing an easy to use interface.
 *
 * It's <b>faster</b> than all the similar libraries like
 * <a href="http://www.canonware.com/rb/">rbtree</a>,
 * <a href="http://judy.sourceforge.net/">judy</a>,
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree/">googlebtree</a>,
 * <a href="http://panthema.net/2007/stx-btree/">stxbtree</a>,
 * <a href="http://attractivechaos.awardspace.com/">khash</a>,
 * <a href="http://uthash.sourceforge.net/">uthash</a>,
 * <a href="http://www.nedprod.com/programs/portable/nedtries/">nedtrie</a>,
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/judyarray/">judyarray</a>,
 * <a href="http://concurrencykit.org/">concurrencykit</a> and others.
 * Only <a href="https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash">googledensehash</a> is a real competitor for Tommy.
 *
 * The data structures provided are:
 *
 * - ::tommy_list - A double linked list.
 * - ::tommy_array, ::tommy_arrayof - A linear array.
 * It doesn't fragment the heap.
 * - ::tommy_arrayblk, ::tommy_arrayblkof - A blocked linear array.
 * It doesn't fragment the heap and it minimizes the space occupation.
 * - ::tommy_hashtable - A fixed size chained hashtable.
 * - ::tommy_hashdyn - A dynamic chained hashtable.
 * - ::tommy_hashlin - A linear chained hashtable.
 * It doesn't have the problem of the delay when resizing and
 * it doesn't fragment the heap.
 * - ::tommy_trie - A trie optimized for cache utilization.
 * - ::tommy_trie_inplace - A trie completely inplace.
 * - ::tommy_tree - A tree to keep elements in order.
 *
 * The most interesting are ::tommy_array, ::tommy_hashdyn, ::tommy_hashlin, ::tommy_trie and ::tommy_trie_inplace.
 *

 *
 * \section Use
 *
 * All the Tommy containers are used to store pointers to generic objects, associated to an
 * integer value, that could be a key or a hash value.
 *
 * They are semantically equivalent at the C++ <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/multimap/">multimap\<unsigned,void*\></a>
 * and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_map/unordered_multimap/">unordered_multimap\<unsigned,void*\></a>.
 *
 * An object, to be inserted in a container, should contain a node of type ::tommy_node.
 * Inside this node is present a pointer to the object itself in the tommy_node::data field,
 * the key used to identify the object in the tommy_node::key field, and other fields used
 * by the containers.
 *
 * This is a typical object declaration:
 * \code
 * struct object {
 *     // other fields
 *     tommy_node node;
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * To insert an object in a container, you have to provide the address of the embedded node,
 * the address of the object and the value of the key.
 * \code
 * int key_to_insert = 1;
 * struct object* obj = malloc(sizeof(struct object));
 * ...
 * tommy_trie_insert(..., &obj->node, obj, key_to_insert);
 * \endcode
 *
 * To search an object you have to provide the key and call the search function.
 * \code
 * int key_to_find = 1;
 * struct object* obj = tommy_trie_search(..., key_to_find);
 * if (obj) {
 *   // found
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To access all the objects with the same keys you have to iterate over the bucket
 * assigned at the specified key.
 * \code
 * int key_to_find = 1;
 * tommy_trie_node* i = tommy_trie_bucket(..., key_to_find);
 *
 * while (i) {
 *     struct object* obj = i->data; // gets the object pointer
 *
 *     printf("%d\n", obj->value); // process the object
 *
 *     i = i->next; // goes to the next element
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To remove an object you have to provide the key and call the remove function.
 * \code
 * int key_to_remove = 1;
 * struct object* obj = tommy_trie_remove(..., key_to_remove);
 * if (obj) {
 *     // found
 *     free(obj); // frees the object allocated memory
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Dealing with hashtables, instead of the key, you have to provide the hash
 * value of the object, and a compare function able to differentiate objects with
 * the same hash value.
 * To compute the hash value, you can use the generic tommy_hash_u32() function,
 * or the specialized integer hash function tommy_inthash_u32().
 *
 * \section Features
 *
 * Tommy is fast and easy to use.
 *
 * Tommy is portable to all platforms and operating systems.
 *
 * Tommy containers support multiple elements with the same key.
 *
 * Tommy containers keep the original insertion order of elements with equal keys.
 *
 * Tommy is released with the \ref license "2-clause BSD license".
 *
 * See the \ref design page for more details and limitations.
 *
 * \section Performance
 * Here you can see some timings comparing with other notable implementations.
 * The <i>Hit</i> graph shows the time required for searching random objects
 * with a key.
 * The <i>Change</i> graph shows the time required for searching, removing and
 * reinsert random objects with a different key value.
 *
 * Times are expressed in nanoseconds for each element, and <b>lower is better</b>.
 *
 * To have some reference numbers, you can check <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">Latency numbers every programmer should know</a>.

 *
 * \section thebenchmark The Benchmark
 *
 * The benchmark consists in storing a set of N pointers to objects and
 * searching them using integer keys.
 *
 * Compared to the case of mapping integers to integers, mapping pointers to
 * objects means that the pointers are also dereferenced, to simulate the
 * object access, resulting in additional cache misses.
 * This gives an advantage to implementations that store information in the
 * objects itself, as the additional cache misses are already implicit.
 *
 * The test done are:
 *  - <b>Insert</b> Insert all the objects starting with an empty container.
 *  - <b>Change</b> Find and remove one object and reinsert it with a different key, repeated for all the objects.
 *  - <b>Hit</b> Find with success all the objects and dereference them.
 *  - <b>Miss</b> Find with failure all the objects.
 *  - <b>Remove</b> Remove all the objects and dereference them.
 *
 * The <i>Change</i>, <i>Hit</i> and <i>Miss</i> tests operate always with N
 * objects in the containers.
 * The <i>Insert</i> test starts with an empty container, and the <i>Remove</i>
 * test ends with an empty container.
 * The objects are always dereferenced, as we are supposing to use them. This
 * happens even in the remove case, as we are supposing to deallocate them.
 *
 * All the objects are preallocated in the heap, and the allocation and deallocation
 * time is not included in the test.
 *
 * The objects contain an integer <i>value</i> field used for consistency checks,
 * an unused <i>payload</i> field of 16 bytes, and any other data required by the
 * data structure.
 *
 * The objects are identified and stored using integer and unique <i>keys</i>.
 * The key domain used is <strong>dense</strong>, and it's defined by the set
 * of N even numbers starting from 0x80000000 to 0x80000000+2*N.
 *
 * The use of even numbers allows to have missing keys inside the domain for
 * the <i>Miss</i> and <i>Change</i> test.
 * In such tests it's used the key domain defined by the set of N odd numbers
 * starting from 0x80000000+1 to 0x80000000+2*N+1.
 * Note that using additional keys at the corners of the domain would have given
 * an unfair advantage to tries and trees as they implicitly keep track of the
 * maximum and minimum key value inserted.
 *
 * The use of the 0x80000000 base, allow to test a key domain not necessarily
 * starting at 0. Using a 0 base would have given an unfair advantage to some
 * implementation handling it as a special case.
 *
 * For all the hashtables the keys are hashed using the tommy_inthash_u32()
 * function that ensures an uniform distribution. This hash function is also
 * reversible, meaning that no collision is going to be caused by hashing the
 * keys. For tries and trees the keys are not hashed, and used directly.
 *
 * The tests are repeated using keys in <i>Random</i> mode and in <i>Forward</i>
 * mode. In the forward mode the key values are used in order from the lowest
 * to the highest.
 * In the random mode the key values are used in a completely random order.
 * In the <i>Change</i> test in forward mode, each object is reinserted using
 * the previous key incremented by 1. In random mode each object is reinserted
 * using a completely different and uncorrelated key.
 *
 * The forward order advantages tries and trees as they use the key directly
 * and they have a cache advantage on using consecutive keys.
 * The random order advantages hashtables, as the hash function already
 * randomizes the key. Usually real uses case are in between, and the random
 * one is the worst case.
 *
 * \section result Results
 *
 * The most significant tests depend on your data usage model, but if in doubt,
 * you can look at <i>Random Hit</i> and <i>Random Change</i>.
 * They represent the real world worst condition.
 *
 * <img src="def/img_random_hit.png"/>
 *
 * In the <i>Random Hit</i> graph you can see a vertical split at the 100.000
 * elements limit. Before this limit the cache of modern processor is able to
 * contains most of the data, and it allows a very fast access with almost all
 * data structures.
 * After this limit, the number of cache misses is the dominant factor, and
 * the curve depends mainly on the number of cache-miss required.
 *
 * rbtree and nedtrie grow as log2(N) as they have two branches on each node,
 * ::tommy_trie_inplace grows as log4(N), ::tommy_trie as log8(N) and hashtables
 * are almost constant and don't grow.
 * For ::tommy_trie_inplace and ::tommy_trie you can change the grow curve
 * configuring a different number of branches for node.
 *
 * <img src="def/img_random_change.png"/>
 *
 * The <i>Random Change</i> graph confirms the vertical split at the 100.000
 * elements limit. It also show that hashtables are almost unbeatable with a
 * random access.
 *
 * \section random Random order
 * Here you can see the whole <i>Random</i> test results in different platforms.
 *
 * In the <i>Random</i> test, hashtables are almost always winning, seconds are
 * tries, and as last trees.
 *
 * The best choices are ::tommy_hashdyn, ::tommy_hashlin, and googledensehash,
 * with ::tommy_hashlin having the advantage to be real-time friendly and not
 * increasing the heap fragmentation.

 * </table>
 *
 * \section forward Forward order
 * Here you can see the whole <i>Forward</i> test results in different platforms.
 *
 * In the <i>Forward</i> test, tries are the winners. Hashtables are competitive
 * until the cache limit, then they lose against tries. Trees are the slowest.
 *
 * The best choices are ::tommy_trie and ::tommy_trie_inplace, where ::tommy_trie is
 * a bit faster, and ::tommy_trie_inplace doesn't require a custom allocator.
 *
 * Note that also hashtables are faster in forward order than random. This may
 * seem a bit surprising as the hash function randomizes the access even with
 * consecutive keys. This happens because the objects are allocated in consecutive
 * memory, and accessing them in order, improves the cache utilization, even if
 * the hashed key is random.
 *
 * Note that you can make hashtables to reach tries performance tweaking the hash
 * function to put near keys allocated nearby.
 * This is possible if you know in advance the distribution of keys.
 * For example, in the benchmark you could use something like:
 * \code
 * #define hash(v) tommy_inthash_u32(v & ~0xF) + (v & 0xF)
 * \endcode
 * and make keys that differ only by the lowest bits to have hashes with the same
 * property, resulting in objects stored nearby, and improving cache utilization.

 * \section notes Notes
 *
 * Here some notes about the data structure tested not part of Tommy.
 *
 * \subsection googlelibchash Google C libchash
 * It's the C implementation located in the <i>experimental/</i> directory of the googlesparsehash archive.
 * It has very bad performances in the <i>Change</i> test for some N values.
 * See this <a href="other/googlelibchash_problem.png">graph</a> with a lot of spikes.
 * The C++ version doesn't suffer of this problem.
 *
 * \subsection googledensehash Google C++ densehash
 * It doesn't release memory on deletion.
 * To avoid an unfair advantage in the <i>Remove</i> test, we force a periodic
 * resize calling resize(0) after any deallocation.
 * The resize is executed when the load factor is lower than 20%.
 *
 * \subsection khash khash
 * It doesn't release memory on deletion. This gives an unfair advantage on the <i>Remove</i> test.
 *
 * \subsection nedtrie nedtrie
 * I've found a crash bug when inserting keys with the 0 value.
 * The <a href="https://github.com/ned14/nedtries/commit/21039696f27db4ffac70a82f89dc5d00ae74b332">fix</a> of this issue is now in the nedtries github.
 * We do not use the C++ implementation as it doesn't compile with gcc 4.4.3.
 *
 * \subsection judy Judy
 * Sometimes it has bad performances in some specific platform
 * and for some specific input data size.
 * This makes difficult to predict the performance, as it is usually good until
 * you get one of these cases.
 * See for example this <a href="other/judy_problem.png">graph</a> with a big replicable spike at 50.000 elements.
 *
 * \subsection ck Concurrency Kit
 * It has very bad performances in the <i>Change</i> test for some N values.
 * See this <a href="other/ck_problem.png">graph</a> with a lot of spikes.
 *
 * \page multiindex Tommy Multi Indexing
 *
 * Tommy provides only partial iterator support with the "foreach" functions.
 * If you need real iterators you have to insert all the objects also in a ::tommy_list,
 * and use the list as iterator.
 *
 * This technique allows to keep track of the insertion order with the list,
 * and provides more search possibilities using different data structures for
 * different search keys.
 *
 * See the next example, for a objects inserted in a ::tommy_list, and in
 * two ::tommy_hashdyn using different keys.
 *
 * \code
 * struct object {
 *     // data fields
 *     int value_0;
 *     int value_1;
 *
 *     // for containers

 *     tommy_node hash_node_0; // node for the first hash
 *     tommy_node hash_node_1; // node for the second hash
 * };
 *
 * // search function for value_1
 * int search_1(const void* arg, const void* obj)
 * {
 *     return *(const int*)arg != ((const struct object*)obj)->value_1;
 * }
 *

 *
 * ...
 *
 * // searches an object by value_1 and deletes it

 *
 * \page design Tommy Design
 *
 * Tommy is designed to fulfill the need of generic data structures for the
 * C language, providing at the same time high performance and a clean
 * and easy to use interface.
 *
 * \section testing Testing
 *
 * Extensive and automated tests with the runtime checker <a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a>
 * and the static analyzer <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">clang</a>
 * are done to ensure the correctness of the library.
 *
 * The test has a <a href="http://www.tommyds.it/cov/tommyds/tommyds">code coverage of 100%</a>,
 * measured with <a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php">lcov</a>.
 *
 * \section Limitations
 *
 * Tommy is not thread safe. You have always to provide thread safety using
 * locks before calling any Tommy functions.
 *
 * Tommy doesn't provide iterators for elements stored in a container.
 * To iterate on elements you must insert them also into a ::tommy_list,
 * and use the list as iterator. See the \ref multiindex example for more details.
 *
 * Tommy doesn't provide an error reporting mechanism for a malloc() failure.
 * You have to provide it redefining malloc() if you expect it to fail.
 *
 * \section compromise Compromises
 *
 * Finding the right balance between efficency and easy to use required some
 * comprimises. Most of them are on memory efficency, and were done to avoid to
 * cripple the interface.
 *
 * The following is a list of such decisions.
 *
 * \subsection multi_key Multi key
 * All the Tommy containers support the insertion of multiple elements with
 * the same key, adding in each node a list of equal elements.
 *
 * They are the equivalent at the C++ associative containers <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/multimap/">multimap\<unsigned,void*\></a>
 * and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_map/unordered_multimap/">unordered_multimap\<unsigned,void*\></a>
 * that allow duplicates of the same key.
 *
 * A more memory conservative approach is to not allow duplicated elements,
 * removing the need of this list.
 *
 * \subsection data_pointer Data pointer
 * The tommy_node::data field is present to allow search and remove functions to return
 * directly a pointer to the element stored in the container.
 *
 * A more memory conservative approach is to require the user to compute
 * the element pointer from the embedded node with a fixed displacement.
 * For an example, see the Linux Kernel declaration of
 * <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=container_of">container_of()</a>.
 *
 * \subsection insertion_order Insertion order
 * The list used for collisions is double linked to allow
 * insertion of elements at the end of the list to keep the
 * insertion order of equal elements.
 *
 * A more memory conservative approach is to use a single linked list,
 * inserting elements only at the start of the list, losing the
 * original insertion order.
 *
 * \subsection zero_list Zero terminated list
 * The 0 terminated format of tommy_node::next is present to provide a forward
 * iterator terminating in 0. This allows the user to write a simple iteration
 * loop over the list of elements in the same bucket.
 *
 * A more efficient approach is to use a circular list, because operating on nodes
 * in a circular list doesn't requires to manage the special terminating case when
 * adding or removing elements.
